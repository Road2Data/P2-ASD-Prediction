# P2 Autism Screening on Adults

GOAL: Using the 700-person survey compiled by Fadi Thabtah, our goal is to explore autism across gender, age, and other variables.
We also want to
predict the likelihood of a person having ASD using survey and demographic variables. We can find the Kaggle Competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/autism-screening-on-adults).
